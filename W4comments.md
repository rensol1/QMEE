## MMV 

Your answer to part 1 is correct.

Your answer to part 2 is thoughtful, but not quite correct. In the absence of more information, the calculation you've done doesn't really add _anything_ to the baseline information, and in particular does not show that their probability of having MMV is low.

## Statistical test

Also thoughtfully done. A non-inferiority approach is _specifically_ for when you are hoping to show that two things are similar. But it sounds like you think they're different. I would like you to sharpen that. Your hypothesis could just be: the difference is big compared to some standard. But I suspect that your hypothesis is really: sex A is bigger than sex B. If that's right, you can just say so. It's still good to have a standard for a size difference you think is important, so that you can compare it to your confidence intervals.

When you are talking about CIs “falling outside”, I think you mean “entirely outside”. Is that correct? Probably better to say so (or something else unambiguous, if you mean something else).
