#W4 Assignment MMV Question

Possible events:
A: Person has MMV
B: Person doesn't have MMV

Probability of events occuring in the population:
PA: 0.01
PB: 0.99

Event occrured:
D: The randomly selected person tests positive for MMV

Likelihood of event occuring:
P(D|A): 1
P(D|B): 0.05

Probability that the person has MMV:
P(A|D) = (1)(0.01)/((1)(0.01) + (0.05)(0.99))
P(A|D) = 0.168

The probability they have MMV is 0.168 (16.8%).

If I learn that a friend tests positive for MMV, I would tell them it is unlikely they actually have MMV and they should be able to control their urge to make mathematical models that attempt to describe biological phenomena.
